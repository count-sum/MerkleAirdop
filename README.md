# Usage

## Pre-deploy: Generate merkle proofs

This step generates merkle proofs for an array of addresses to airdrop funds to. If you'd like to work with the default addresses and proofs already created in this repo, skip to [deploy](#deploy)

If you'd like to work with a different array of addresses (the `whitelist` list in `GenerateInput.s.sol`), you will need to follow the following:

First, the array of addresses to airdrop to needs to be updated in `GenerateInput.s.sol. To generate the input file and then the merkle root and proofs, run the following:

Using make:

```bash
make merkle
```

Or using the commands directly:

```bash
forge script script/GenerateInput.s.sol:GenerateInput && forge script script/MakeMerkle.s.sol:MakeMerkle
```

Then, retrieve the `root` (there may be more than 1, but they will all be the same) from `script/target/output.json` and paste it in the `Makefile` as `ROOT` and update `s_merkleRoot` in `DeployMerkleAirdrop.s.sol` for Ethereum/Anvil deployments.

# Deploy 

## Deploy to Anvil

```bash
# Optional, ensure you're on vanilla foundry
foundryup
# Run a local anvil node
make anvil
# Then, in a second terminal
make deploy
```

## Interacting - Local anvil network

### Setup anvil and deploy contracts

Swap back to vanilla foundry and run an anvil node:

```bash
foundryup
make anvil
make deploy
# Copy the BagelToken address & Airdrop contract address
```
Copy the Bagel Token and Aidrop contract addresses and paste them into the `AIRDROP_ADDRESS` and `TOKEN_ADDRESS` variables in the `MakeFile`

The following steps allow the second default anvil address (`0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8`) to call claim and pay for the gas on behalf of the first default anvil address (`0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`) which will recieve the airdrop. 

### Sign your airdrop claim  

```bash
# in another terminal
make sign
```

Retrieve the signature bytes outputted to the terminal and add them to `Interact.s.sol` *making sure to remove the `0x` prefix*. 

Additionally, if you have modified the claiming addresses in the merkle tree, you will need to update the proofs in this file too (which you can get from `output.json`)


### Claim your airdrop

Then run the following command:

```bash
make claim
```

### Check claim amount

Then, check the claiming address balance has increased by running

```bash
make balance
```

NOTE: `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266` is the default anvil address which has recieved the airdropped tokens.


## Testing

```bash
foundryup
forge test
```
